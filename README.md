# Plagerism-Checker-Using-longest-consecutive-sequence-LCS-

Plagiarism Checker
A user-friendly plagiarism detection tool built using Python's Tkinter library. This tool compares two text inputs and calculates their similarity using the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. Additionally, it provides a visual loading bar and a clear indicator of whether plagiarism is likely or not.

Features
Longest Common Subsequence Algorithm: Accurately compares two paragraphs of text and calculates their similarity as a percentage.
Intuitive User Interface: Built with Tkinter, featuring a clean and modern design.
Loading Bar: A dynamic progress bar simulates processing, enhancing user experience.
Plagiarism Detection Indicator: Outputs whether plagiarism is detected based on a similarity threshold.
How It Works
Enter two paragraphs of text in the respective input fields.
Click the "Check Plagiarism" button.
The application calculates:
The length of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).
The similarity ratio (percentage).
The result is displayed as:
Similarity Percentage: Numeric similarity value.
Plagiarism Indicator:
Most likely plagiarism detected (if similarity â‰¥ 50%).
No plagiarism detected (if similarity < 50%).
